<P>Syntax:</B> #speedwalk [on/off]</P>
<P>This option toggles the "speedwalking mode" ON/OFF. Speedwalking is the ability to issue multiple direction commands in the one command. Every command typed by the user and containing ONLY n,s,e,w,d,u and digit symbols is assumed to be a "speedwalk". This means the command will be split into seperate movement commands and then sent to the MUD. You can also use a repeat counter (numbers) before a direction symbol to indicate how many times that direction should be repeated.</P>
<P>Second parameter of this command is not necessary. Valid values is "ON" or "OFF". If you don’t use it JMC will change current speedwalk   state to the inverted state.</P>
<B><P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Example:</P>
</B><I><P>2ned4s </P>
</I><P>n n e d s s s s commands will be sent to the MUD.</P>
<P>When the "speedwalk" mode is OFF a command of such type will be sent to MUD as is. <B>NOTE!</B> When the "speedwalking" mode is ON you cant use commands like "news" (to issue a command to the MUD that contains only speedwalk letters, change one (or more) of the letters to a capital, e.g. "News").</P></BODY>
