<P>What is a profile?</P>

<P>A profile is a group of JMC’s options and hotkeys. The JMC uses two kinds of option: common and private.  Common options are shared between profiles. These options don’t change when you choose a new or different profile. Private options are not shared, and so change when switching between profiles.</P>

<P>Why are profiles needed?</P>

<P>Profiles are useful for changing various options when you decide to play another character or another MUD. For instance, you might use ‘;’ as the command delimiter.  If one of your favorite MUDs uses this character as part of the a command, you would have to change it to another character.  The solution is to create a new profile, where the command delimiter for each MUD is defined according to that MUD.  That way, once you save the changes to the profile, you don't need to manually change all the options when you switch to another character or a different MUD.  You only need to change the profile.  The other reason to create different profiles, are the hotkeys. Hotkeys are specific to a profile. If you play two characters, a mage and a warrior, you might use different hotkeys for each character.  A mage’s hotkeys might be "cast ‘cone of cold’", "cast ‘shield’", etc; whereas the warrior's hotkeys might be "rescue Lesath", "kick $target", etc.  Using profiles to switch between characters is more comfortable and conveniant than redefining the hotkeys every time you wish to change to another character.</P>
