<h3>What is JMC?</h3>

<p>JMC (Jaba Mud Client) is a Mud Client - an application which helps you to play MUDs. If
you've played a MUD even once, you know that the client software is very important.
Aliases, triggers, hotkeys - these are just some of the things that make playing easier,
by avoiding tiresome typing, or repetition of commands.</p>

<p>Since JMC is one of these programs, it allows you to define aliases, use triggers on
MUD events, analyse a situation, and more. JMC also allows you to define hotkeys and
perform complex actions with the one keypress. </p>

<p>What makes JMC different from other MUD clients? JMC is very fast and powerful. Text
drawing is as fast as it possible on your computer. The macro language is very powerful
and allows you to create complex macros. JMC&#146;s macro engine is very fast too, meaning
you can create and destroy hundreds of aliases/triggers.</p>

<p>If you are an experienced player, you have to write complex actions/commands/triggers.
JMC provides a powerful and popular script language, which is also compatible with the
TinTin++ script language. However JMC is not just a port of TinTin for Windows9x/NT. Some
TinTin commands don&#146;t exist in JMC and there are few commands that are different from
TinTin. However the language syntax is the same as TinTin&#146;s. If you are an old
TinTin's user, check the help files to check the syntax.</p>

<p>Character substitutions are one of the powerful features that allow you to avoid
problems with the upper part of the ANSI table.</p>

<p>When you install the JMC on your computer, you also install the RMA player. RMA is a
nice utility, which allows you to play your favourite logs again and again. See more
information about the RMA player <a href="rma.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike other popular MUD clients, JMC has a poor user interface. This does not mean JMC
is a command-line only client. It means JMC doesn&#146;t make you set up your
triggers/actions/macros and other options by the clients way only. JMC doesn&#146;t make
you to have one profile for one character. JMC doesn&#146;t make you keep all your macros
in one file. It allows you to create comfortable environments for different MUDs or for
different characters. You can set up interface parameters (such as ANSI colors, command
history size, command char, command delimiter, etc) on an individual basis.</p>

<p>Here is a full list of the JMC&#146;s features:</p>

<p>Provides full ANSI colors support.</p>

<p>Records your last input in the command history. You can change the history size and
commandline options.</p>

<p>Powerful macro language, compatible with the TinTin++ macros, allows you to make
macros, from simple aliases to complex commands.</p>

<p>You can apply more than one trigger to any one line. So, you are able to trigger one
line more than once and retrieve more than one piece of information at one time.</p>

<p>You can define hotkeys (from the interface and from the commands).</p>

<p>Profiling, which allows you to split various options into groups. You can switch
profiles at any time without needing to reconnect.</p>

<p>Logging all the information into a file is available. The optional ANSI codes/RMA
extensions can be logged as well.</p>

<p>JMC installation installs the RMA player.</p>

<p>Substitution of the characters coming from the MUD. It is useful if you don&#146;t like
any symbols coming from the MUD, or for national (non-English MUDs).</p>

<p>You can load/save your macros from/to a file any time you want to do it. </p>
