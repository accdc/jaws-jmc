</B><P>Well. If you used JMC 2.15 long time and downloaded JMC 3.* first time, you need some info about futures, implemented. </P>
<P>First, interface changed a lot. JMC now able to split main window while backscroll, so you may keep looking for current situation in the MUD while backscrolling buffer. Also, added extended window (its dockable and may be attached to any part of JMC window or moved out of it). You able to display any text in this window by <A HREF="output.htm">#output</A> command. </P>
<P>JMC now able to save logs into HTML form. Look <A HREF="log.html">#log</A>  for more info.</P>
<P>ActiveScripting support added ! Now you able to make real complex analyze of incoming text  and do very complex  actions, to use databases etc.</P>
<P><A HREF="group_descr.html">Groups of commands</A> implemented. </P>
<P>Statusbar of the JMC main window changed – its have new form and got 3 cells with user-defined text in it. Look at <A HREF="status.htm">#status</A> command.</P>
<P>A lot of command’s format changed (for compatibility, old formats still accepted, just added new parameters ):</P>
