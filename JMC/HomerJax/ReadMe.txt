HomerJax is a library of convenience functions for accessing Internet resources.  It is written primarily in JScript, the Microsoft version of JavaScript.  The library exploits several COM servers that the Windows operating system installs.  As a Windows Script Component, HomerJax may be activated without the usually-needed, supporting entries in the Windows registry, which require administrative rights to create with an installer.

HomerJax functions focus on reading, interpreting, and writing data from the Internet.  Full documentation is in the file HomerJax.htm.
